    "  * Cards have a `suit` attribute that can be spades, hearts, diamonds or clubs\n",
    "  * Cards have a values of ace, king, queen, jack, 10...2\n",
    "  * Cards have a numeric value from 2 to 10 (face cards) and aces = 11\n",
    "  * Cards have a display method that prints the suit and the value\n",
    " \n",
    "* Create a **Deck** class\n",
    "  * **Deck** class has an attribute called cards and when you create an instance of a **Deck** the attribute will be a list of 52 instances of the **Card** class that have been shuffled\n",
    "  * **Deck** class has a deal method that pops one instance from the cards attribute\n",
    "  * If the cards attribute is empty, the user will be prompted that there are no cards left\n",
    "  * **Deck** class has a reshuffle method that fills the cards attribute   \n",
